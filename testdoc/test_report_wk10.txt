# File: test_plan.txt
# Description: A test plan document for my implementation of the LOST Web Application

Step 1 - Create a fresh instance of the OSNAP VM base image.

Step 2 - Using the following two commands, clone the contents of my git repo into the image, then move them to the appropriate location.

         git clone https://github.com/zplunte/cis322.git ./gitrep
         cp -r gitrep/* ./

Step 3 - Initialize the database server with the next command which runs initlostdb.sh

         ./initlostdb.sh

Note: You should see some scrolling text that confirms the database server is being setup.

Step 4 - Create the LOST Web Application database with the following command

         createdb lost

Step 5 - Run preflight.sh with lost database to create tables and populate wsgi with src files. The command you should use is

         ./preflight.sh lost

Note: You should see a series of 'CREATE TABLE' messages echoed back after running this command.

Step 6 - Start the Apache web server with the following command

         apachectl start 

Step 7 - Verify that the server is running by visiting localhost:8080 in a web browser.You should see a login page with the OSNAP insignia and a 'create user' button.

Step 8 - Create a user and explore the site. First create a Logistics Officer so that you can create facilities, create assets, dispose a few assets, and make a transfer request. You should also check the Asset Report page to verify that it works correctly. Then create a Facilities Officer so that you can approve transfer requests. You should then return to a Logistics Officer account and test the set load/unload times functionality.

Step 9 - Verify that the data you entered through your browser has been stored in the database by running the following commands and looking for the entries in the psql database.

         psql lost
         select * from users;
         select * from facilities;
         select * from assets;
         select * from transfers;

Step 10 - Test the export functionality by navigating into the export directory and running export_data.sh with the appropriate arguments. The commands you should use are

          cd export/
          ./export_data.sh lost test_export

Note: This should create the directory test_export/ in the directory export/ and it should now be populated with appropriate .csv files. Navigate into test_export/ and verify the contents of the .csv files with the following commands

                cd test_export/
                ls
                more users.csv
                more facilities.csv
                more assets.csv
                more transfers.csv

Step 11 - Navigate back to the main directory with this command
 
          cd ../..

Step 12 - Drop this database and then recreate a clean version so that we can test our import scripts. Use the following commands to get a clean version of the database.

          apachectl stop
          dropdb lost
          createdb lost
          ./preflight.sh lost
          apachectl start

Note: After running ./preflight.sh lost you should see the same list of 'CREATE TABLE' statements as before.

Step 13 - Test the import functionality by navigating into the import directory and running test_import.sh with the appropriate arguments. The commands you should use are

          cd import/
          ./test_import.sh lost

Note: You should see a scrolling series of echo messages displaying the progress of the import. These should terminate quickly with no error, returning you to a command line prompt.

Step 14 - Verify that the import step worked correctly with the following commands

          psql lost
          select * from users;
          select * from facilities;
          select * from assets;
          select * from transfers;

# That's it for now! Hope everything works.
